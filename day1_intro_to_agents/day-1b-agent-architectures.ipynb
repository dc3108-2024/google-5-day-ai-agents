    "\n",
    "**Welcome to the Kaggle 5-day Agents course!**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous notebook, you built a **single agent** that could take action. Now, you'll learn how to scale up by building **agent teams**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like a team of people, you can create specialized agents that collaborate to solve complex problems. This is called a **multi-agent system**, and it's one of the most powerful concepts in AI agent development.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you'll:\n",
    "\n",
    "- ✅ Learn when to use multi-agent systems in [Agent Development Kit (ADK)](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/)\n",
    "- ✅ Build your first system using an LLM as a \"manager\"\n",
    "- ✅ Learn three core workflow patterns (Sequential, Parallel, and Loop) to coordinate your agent teams\n",

    "> ❌ **ℹ️ Note: No submission required!**\n",
    "> This notebook is for your hands-on practice and learning only. You **do not** need to submit it anywhere to complete the course.\n",
    "\n",
    "> ⏸️ **Note:**  When you first start the notebook via running a cell you might see a banner in the notebook header that reads **\"Waiting for the next available notebook\"**. The queue should drop rapidly; however, during peak bursts you might have to wait a few minutes.\n",
    "\n",
    "> ❌ **Note:** Avoid using the **Run all** cells command as this can trigger a QPM limit resulting in 429 errors when calling the backing model. Suggested flow is to run each cell in order - one at a time. [See FAQ on 429 errors for more information.](https://www.kaggle.com/code/kaggle5daysofai/day-0-troubleshooting-and-faqs)\n",

      "**Headline:** Level Up Your Code: How Multi-Agent Systems Are Your Secret Weapon\n",
      "\n",
      "**Introduction Hook:** Ever feel like your software projects are becoming too complex to manage alone? Imagine a team of intelligent, autonomous \"assistants\" working tirelessly behind the scenes, optimizing, debugging, and even generating code. That's the power of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS), and they're poised to revolutionize how we develop software.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "**Main Section 1: Enhanced Problem Solving and Complexity Management**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Decomposition Powerhouse:** MAS allows you to break down large, intricate problems into smaller, manageable sub-problems. Each agent can specialize in a specific task, making the overall system easier to understand, develop, and maintain.\n",
      "*   **Distributed Intelligence:** Instead of a single monolithic application, MAS distributes intelligence across multiple agents. This means tasks can be executed in parallel, leading to faster processing and improved scalability, especially for complex simulations or data analysis.\n",
      "*   **Adaptability and Resilience:** Individual agents can adapt to changing environments or failures. If one agent encounters an issue, others can potentially take over its tasks or compensate, making the system more robust and less prone to catastrophic failure.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Main Section 2: Boosting Development Efficiency and Innovation**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Automated Code Generation and Refactoring:** Imagine agents that can suggest code snippets, refactor existing code for better performance or readability, and even identify potential bugs before they become a problem. MAS can automate repetitive and time-consuming development tasks.\n",
      "*   **Intelligent Testing and Debugging:** Agents can be designed to autonomously test various scenarios, identify edge cases, and pinpoint the root cause of bugs with greater precision than traditional methods. This frees up human developers to focus on more creative and strategic aspects.\n",
      "*   **Accelerated Prototyping and Exploration:** With agents capable of generating initial code structures or exploring design alternatives, MAS can significantly speed up the prototyping phase. Developers can quickly iterate on ideas and experiment with different solutions.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Main Section 3: Fostering Collaboration and Knowledge Sharing**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Agent-to-Agent Communication:** Agents within a MAS can communicate and collaborate with each other, sharing information, coordinating actions, and collectively working towards a common goal. This mirrors human team dynamics, but with computational speed and precision.\n",
      "*   **Knowledge Representation and Transfer:** Agents can encapsulate specific domain knowledge and expertise. This knowledge can be shared and transferred between agents, facilitating learning within the system and potentially even aiding human developers in understanding complex domains.\n",
      "*   **Simulating Real-World Scenarios:** MAS is incredibly powerful for simulating complex interactions and emergent behaviors, like in economics, traffic management, or even social dynamics. This allows developers to test hypotheses and understand system-wide consequences in a controlled environment.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "**Concluding Thought:** Multi-Agent Systems are no longer just a theoretical concept; they are a practical and powerful toolkit for modern software development. By embracing MAS, developers can unlock new levels of efficiency, tackle unprecedented complexity, and ultimately build more intelligent and resilient software solutions. Are you ready to integrate your own team of digital collaborators?\n",

      "MAS offers a potent approach to **enhanced problem-solving and complexity management**. By breaking down intricate problems into smaller, specialized tasks for individual agents, MAS makes large systems more digestible and maintainable. This distributed intelligence enables parallel processing for faster execution and improved scalability, perfect for demanding simulations or data analysis. Furthermore, the resilience of MAS means that if one agent falters, others can often compensate, leading to more robust applications.\n",
      "\n",
      "Beyond managing complexity, MAS is a major boost for **development efficiency and innovation**. Think automated code generation, intelligent refactoring suggestions, and even proactive bug detection. Agents can autonomously test various scenarios, uncover edge cases, and pinpoint issues with remarkable accuracy, freeing you to focus on higher-level strategy. Prototyping also gets a significant speed-up, allowing for rapid iteration and exploration of design alternatives.\n",

Strange, swirling symbols marked a coastline he didn’t recognize, and a single, luminous X pulsed at the heart of a forgotten archipelago. The light from the map cast an eerie, aquamarine glow on his grizzled face, igniting a flicker of an old, long-dormant ember of adventure within him.\n",
      "CriticAgent > The plot is intriguing, setting up a classic treasure-hunt scenario with a unique twist of the map's material. However, it feels like the very beginning of a much larger story, lacking a clear arc or resolution within this excerpt.\n",
      "\n",
      "The character of Elias is well-established as a lonely, routine-bound figure, making the discovery of the map a significant catalyst for change. His long dormancy and the \"long-dormant ember of adventure\" hint at a past or a potential future, but more internal conflict or a reaction beyond awe could deepen his character.\n",
      "\n",
      "The pacing is a bit too swift. The discovery and immediate understanding of the map happen very quickly. A slightly slower reveal, perhaps Elias puzzling over the symbols or the nature of the \"kelp\" for a moment, could build more suspense and allow the reader to share in his wonder and confusion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here are a few actionable suggestions for improvement:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Deepen Elias's immediate reaction:** Instead of just gasping and recognizing it as a map, Elias could have a moment of confusion or disbelief. For example, he might initially think it's a strange piece of seaweed, or struggle to decipher the symbols, adding a layer of realism to his isolated existence and the unexpected nature of the discovery.\n",
      "2.  **Expand on the map's mystery:** Briefly hint at what the symbols might represent, or describe Elias's attempt to orient himself. This could involve him comparing it to his known charts, or noting features that are utterly alien, further emphasizing the \"forgotten archipelago\" and the map's significance.\n",
      "3.  **Introduce a small conflict or consequence of the discovery:** Even a subtle internal conflict could enrich the narrative. For instance, Elias might immediately feel a pang of fear or doubt, questioning if this is a dangerous path, or he might feel a sudden pull to abandon his post, creating immediate stakes.\n",
      "RefinerAgent > Elias, a man weathered by salt spray and solitude, polished the great lens of the lighthouse, its beam a familiar comfort against the encroaching dusk. He’d lived in this stone tower for thirty years, its echoes his only companions. Tonight, however, was different. Tucked behind a loose stone in the keeper’s log, he found it – a rolled parchment, brittle with age, yet pulsating with an inner light.\n",
      "\n",
      "He pulled it free, his calloused fingers brushing against its strange surface. At first, he mistook it for a particularly resilient piece of dried seaweed, perhaps a relic from a storm long past. But as he unfurled it, the peculiar material began to glow with an ethereal, aquamarine light. Elias gasped, not in awe, but in confusion. This was no ordinary parchment. It was some kind of phosphorescent kelp, intricately woven into a map.\n",
      "\n",
      "Strange, swirling symbols, unlike any he’d ever seen, marked a coastline that was utterly alien to him. He fumbled for his own worn charts, spreading them on the rough wooden table. Nothing. No jagged inlets, no clustered islands that matched the luminous X pulsing at the map’s heart. This was a forgotten archipelago, a place lost to time and tide. The map's glow cast an eerie light on his grizzled face, and for the first time in decades, Elias felt a tremor of something other than routine – a prickle of unease, a whisper of forgotten dreams, and a sudden, sharp fear. What ancient secret had he unearthed? Was this a path to fortune, or a siren’s call to ruin? The familiar, comforting beam of the lighthouse suddenly seemed like a fragile barrier against a world far vaster and more mysterious than he had ever imagined.\n",
      "CriticAgent > The plot is well-conceived, establishing a clear mystery and a compelling hook with the glowing map. The character of Elias is effectively portrayed as a solitary figure whose quiet existence is disrupted, creating immediate emotional resonance. The pacing is generally good, with the discovery and unfolding of the map's secrets happening at a measured pace that builds intrigue.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here are a few specific, actionable suggestions for improvement:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Enhance the description of the map's texture and feel:** While the \"strange surface\" and \"peculiar material\" are mentioned, a more tactile description could further immerse the reader. For example, describe if it felt smooth, rough, cool, or strangely warm to Elias's calloused fingers, adding a sensory detail that emphasizes its unusual nature.\n",
      "2.  **Show, don't just tell, Elias's internal conflict:** The sentence \"Elias felt a tremor of something other than routine – a prickle of unease, a whisper of forgotten dreams, and a sudden, sharp fear\" is good, but could be more impactful. Consider showing these feelings through Elias's physical reactions – perhaps his hand trembles, his breath catches, or his gaze darts towards the dark sea outside, as if expecting something to emerge.\n",
      "3.  **Add a concrete detail that links the map to the lighthouse or Elias's past:** To strengthen the immediate significance of the discovery, Elias could find a small, almost imperceptible symbol on the map that *remotely* resembles a marking on his lighthouse, or a knot he used to tie, or a fragment of a story his predecessor told him. This would make the map feel less entirely alien and more directly connected to his world, even if the connection is subtle.\n",
      "RefinerAgent > Elias, a man weathered by salt spray and solitude, polished the great lens of the lighthouse, its beam a familiar comfort against the encroaching dusk.

      "\n",
      "He pulled it free, his calloused fingers brushing against its strange surface. It felt unnervingly smooth, cool to the touch like the deep sea itself, yet vibrated with a faint, inner warmth.

He traced a faint spiral on the map’s edge, his eyes widening as he realized it bore a striking, albeit miniature, resemblance to the distinctive spiral carving on the lighthouse's main support beam, a detail left by the tower’s original architect. This was a forgotten archipelago, a place lost to time and tide. The map's glow cast an eerie light on his grizzled face. His hand began to tremble, the parchment crinkling slightly.
